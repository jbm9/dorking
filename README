dorking is a quick bit of experimenting with stacking terrible
astrophotographs.

I found out that my 300mm telephoto lens was good enough to see
the moons of Jupiter, and wanted to do a bit better job of it.
After the first bit of experimentation, it was clear that I would
need to use more advanced steps, like stacking.  I tried a few
of the off-the-shelf things, but they confused the everloving
crap out of me, so I decided to quickly slap something together,
just to see what I could see.

This is that.
